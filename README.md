# Puppy Playgroup

### Puppy Playgroup is a website for puppy owners who are interested in socialising their young dog with others in a safe and controlled environment.

### The website allows users to find information about the playgroup, meet up times, contact information and a sign up form.

# Features

* Navigation
  * Featured at the top of the page, the navigation shows links to the left: About Us, Schedule, Sign Up and Contact which link to different sections on the same page.
  * The navigation has a light font with dark background so that it stands out for the user.
  * The navigation bar is fixed on screens larger than 620px so that the user can easily navigate to a section wherever they are on the site.
  * On screens smaller than 620px, the navigation bar is not fixed to avoid taking up too much space on a small screen.
  * The navigation clearly tells the user what they will find on the website and makes the different sections easy to find.

# Testing

* I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge.
* I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
* I confirmed that the navigation, header, about us, schedule, sign up and contact text are all readable and easy to understand.
* I have confirmed that the form works: requires entries in every field but one which is listed as optional, will only accept an email in the email field and the submit button works.

### Issues that I encountered during testing

* While testing responsiveness on smaller screens I found that the navigation bar took up too much room on screens smaller than 620px wide. I decided not to fix the navigation bar on screens smaller than 620px wide so that it would not get in the way of the users experience.
* I was having issues with using float. Everytime I entered a new code, the previous float would be messed up. I ended up replacing float with flex which made things much more simpler.
* While testing on W3C validator, I had one error. On the form, I left the value to action and method as #.

## Validator Testing

* HTML
  * One error was found when passing through the official W3C validator
  * The error was fixed and no errors were found
* CSS
  * No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
* Accessibility
  * I confirmed that the color and fonts chosen are easy to read and accesible by running it through lighthouse in devtools
