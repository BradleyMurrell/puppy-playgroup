# Features

* Navigation
  * Featured at the top of the page, the navigation shows links to the left: About Us, Schedule, Sign Up and Contact which link to different sections on the same page.
  * The navigation has a light font with dark background so that it stands out for the user.
  * The navigation bar is fixed on screens larger than 620px so that the user can easily navigate to a section wherever they are on the site.
  * On screens smaller than 620px, the navigation bar is not fixed to avoid taking up too much space on a small screen.
  * The navigation clearly tells the user what they will find on the website and makes the different sections easy to find.
